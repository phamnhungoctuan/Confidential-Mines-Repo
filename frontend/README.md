# 🎮 Confidential Mines UI

This is the frontend application for **Confidential Mines**, a fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) powered
Minesweeper-style game built with **Vite, React.js, and TypeScript**.

Players pick tiles on an encrypted board — bomb positions remain **confidential** thanks to FHEVM, ensuring fairness and
privacy onchain.
